- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Golam Shahed Rafeed. I am from Bangladesh.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested Backend Development and it is my first preference in my software developer career. I have also interest in mobile app development in Android.

- ðŸŒ± I love and prefer Java as my primary programming language. I am more drawn towards learning and exploring different software development platforms that are based on Java. I'm currently learning and practicing backend development with Spring Boot which i find so much facinating.
